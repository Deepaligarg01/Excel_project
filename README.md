# 📊 Cancer Patient Data Analysis (Excel Project)

## 📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of cancer patients using Microsoft Excel.  
It includes data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard reporting to uncover meaningful insights into patient demographics, lifestyle habits (like smoking and drinking), and disease severity.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
- **Total Patients**: (update as needed)
- **Key Features**:
  - **Patient ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
  - **Age**: Patient's age.
  - **Gender**: Male or Female.
  - **Cancer Type**: Type of cancer (Brain, Lung, Blood, etc.).
  - **Stage**: Cancer stage (1–4).
  - **Drinker/Smoker**: Lifestyle factors.
  - **Heart Patient**: Presence of heart disease.
  - **Level**: Risk level (Low, Medium, High).
  - **Recovery Status**: (CUREABLE, NOT CURABLE, etc.)

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Created Pivot Tables to:
  - Analyze correlation between drinking/smoking habits and heart disease.
  - Summarize patient count based on risk levels.
- Built an interactive Dashboard for easy visualization.

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Patients with "High" risk levels had higher instances of heart disease.
- Lifestyle habits like smoking and drinking showed a strong relationship with disease progression.
